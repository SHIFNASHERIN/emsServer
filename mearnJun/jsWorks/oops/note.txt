oop(object oriented programming)
--------------------------------

procedural programming
object oriented programming 


class        - deasign pattern /basic structure/blueprint
object       - real-world entity 
reference    - to store object for further operations(same as variables)
constructor  - to initialize the object at the 
               time of object creation
inheritance  - used to access properties(methods and atributes) of one class in 
               another class
                    -single inheritance 
                    -multiple inheritance - not support
                    -multilevel/hierarchical inheritance
polymorphism - same method name 
                    -overloading - same method name and diff num of argmnts.
                     object identify method by using num of argmnts given
                     while calling methods(js not supporting)
                    -over-riding - same method name and same num of argmnts
                     latest created method over-rides other methods

abstraction    -
ancapsulation  -


identifiers
-----------

- variables
- function name
- class name 


CRUD 

C- create - add
R- read - access
U- update
D- delete

DOM- Document object model
